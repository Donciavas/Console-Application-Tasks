# Console Applications

# HierarchicalStructure console app.
Imagine we have a hierarchical structure:

After creating this object, we can add new Branch type objects into branches
variable. Doing so we increase object depth by one. Into created objects we can
add again new branches etc. In the figure below we have similar structure.

This structure depth is 5. Please write a program, where you would create similar structure. Pass this structure into your own
created method and calculate the depth of provided structure. Main requirement to complete this
task: use recursion.

# AngleBetweenClockArrows console app. 
User should be able to input hours and minutes of the analogue clock.
Program must calculate lesser angle in degrees between hours arrow and minutes arrow and provide
output in the console window.
